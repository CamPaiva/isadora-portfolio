# Isadora Campregher Paiva's Projects Portfolio

This is a selection of some of the data science projects I have made independently to showcase what I can do.

## Project 1: Sight&Sound's Greatest Films of All Time 2012-2022
A comparison of Sight&Sound's Greatest Films of All Time 2012 and 2022 lists. This was a personal project done for the fun of it. I compiled the data myself using the Sight & Sound lists and enriching the data through Wikidata and OMDb. What you see here is the data visualizations I did from the resulting data, comparing for instance the percentage of films directed by women in the two lists, the directors with the most films on each list, the most represented countries, etc.

## Project 2: Netflix Data 
This project was undertaken for the R for Data Science Advanced course at [TechAcademy](https://www.tech-academy.io/) in 2022/2023. We were supposed to follow a (Guide/Leitfaden) indicating the tasks we had to accomplish. The project used two datasets: a [general one from from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) and one with one's personal data from Netflix, which anyone can request. The first portion, shown here, is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## Project 3: Airbnb Amsterdam
This project was undertaken for the Python for Data Science Advanced course at [TechAcademy](https://www.tech-academy.io/) in 2021/2022. 
We were supposed to follow a (Guide/Leitfaden)[] indicating the tasks we had to accomplish.
The project used data from Airbnb, and each individual had to work on a specific city. Mine was Amsterdam.
The first portion is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and visualization, and the second to a price prediction model using machine learning.
